# ML-Cellsegmentation-HSLU-FS24

This branch contains the data of Samuel Hurni for the ML project in MachineLearning and Datascience at the HSLU in the Master in IT Digitlaization & Sustainability.

Part of this branch is the competition from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation

All work was done in jupyter notebook on google collab:
Filename: Sartorius-Segmentation_kaggle_Sam_v999

Several trainings were performed with A100 GPU (advanced mask head) and T4GPU (leaner mask head).

The results were not satisfactory (approx. 0.07 according to coco API eval), but some improvements could be made. Together with a longer training time and better GPU performance, the training is more or less satisfactory.

Further explanations on  can be found in the Jupyter notebook file itself.
